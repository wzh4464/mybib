Tricolorability is an isotopy invariant, and hence can be used to distinguish between two different (non-isotopic) knots.  In particular, since the unknot is not tricolorable, any tricolorable knot is necessarily nontrivial.},

This is based on the coordinate description of the corresponding point on the ellipse for the given point, where the connecting line of the two points is the shortest path from the given point to the ellipse. As a practical application example, we show the geometric ellipse fitting to the image of circular point targets, where the contour points are weighted with their image gradient across the boundary of the image ellipse.},

The WKS represents the average probability of measuring a quantum mechanical particle at a specific location. By letting vary the energy of the particle, the WKS encodes and separates information from various different Laplace eigenfrequencies. This clear scale separation makes the WKS well suited for a large variety of applications. Both theoretically and in quantitative experiments we demonstrate that the WKS is substantially more discriminative and therefore allows for better feature matching than the commonly used Heat Kernel Signature (HKS). As an application of the WKS in shape analysis we show results on shape matching.},

As graph datasets have grown in size and density, a range of highly-scalable balanced partitioning algorithms have appeared to meet varied demands across different domains. As the starting point for the present work, we observe that two recently introduced families of iterative partitioners---those based on restreaming and those based on balanced label propagation (including Facebook's Social Hash Partitioner)---can be viewed through a common modular framework of design decisions. With the help of this modular perspective, we find that a key combination of design decisions leads to a novel family of algorithms with notably better empirical performance than any existing highly-scalable algorithm on a broad range of real-world graphs. The resulting prioritized restreaming algorithms employ a constraint management strategy based on multiplicative weights, borrowed from the restreaming literature, while adopting notions of priority from balanced label propagation to optimize the ordering of the streaming process. Our experimental results consider a range of stream orders, where a dynamic ordering based on what we call ambivalence is broadly the most performative in terms of the cut quality of the resulting balanced partitions, with a static ordering based on degree being nearly as good.},

The algorithm includes two parts: contour pre-processing and ellipse processing. The purpose of contour pre-processing is to smooth fluctuations of the contour, find concave points of the contour and divide the contour into different segments via the concave points. The purpose of ellipse processing is to process the different segments of the contour into possible single cells by using the properties of the fitted ellipses. Because concave points divide the whole contour of touching cells into different segments and different segments of one single cell have similar properties, the ellipse processing can separate the touching cells through ellipse fitting. This paper demonstrates a new way of using ellipse fitting to split the binary contour of touching cells. Experimental results show that our algorithm is efficient. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The initial work showed how to detect both analytic curves(1,2) and non-analytic curves,(3) but these methods were restricted to binary edge images. This work was generalized to the detection of some analytic curves in grey level images, specifically lines,(4) circles(5) and parabolas.(6) The line detection case is the best known of these and has been ingeniously exploited in several applications.(7,8,9) We show how the boundaries of an arbitrary non-analytic shape can be used to construct a mapping between image space and Hough transform space. Such a mapping can be exploited to detect instances of that particular shape in an image. Furthermore, variations in the shape such as rotations, scale changes or figure ground reversals correspond to straightforward transformations of this mapping. However, the most remarkable property is that such mappings can be composed to build mappings for complex shapes from the mappings of simpler component shapes. This makes the generalized Hough transform a kind of universal transform which can be used to find arbitrarily complex shapes.},

These methods, however, suffer from biased estimates and sensitivity to outlier data. In this paper a real-time, least-squares method is proposed that provides an indirect geometric fit based on the quadratic polynomial form of parallel chord lengths. The algorithm is shown to be more computationally efficient and more easily made robust to outlier data than algebraic methods. Experimental results also suggest that it provides estimates that suffer less from bias error.},

A preprocessing phase is used in which real world images are transformed - noise reduction, greyscale transform, edge detection and finaly binarization - in order to be processed by the actual ellipse detector. The ellipse detector filters out false ellipses that may interfere with the final results. Due to the fact that usually more ``virtual'' ellipses are detected for one ``real'' ellipse, a data clustering scheme is used, the clustering method, classifies all detected ``virtual'' ellipses into their corresponding ``real'' ellipses. The post processing phase is VQ similar and it also finds the actual number of classes unknown a priori.},

It then covers string geometry (including Calabi\textendash Yau compactifications) and flux compactifications, and applications to cosmology and particle physics. One chapter is dedicated to black holes in string theory and M-theory, and the microscopic origin of black-hole entropy. The book concludes by presenting matrix theory, AdS/CFT duality and its generalizations. This book is ideal for graduate students studying modern string theory, and it will make an excellent textbook for a 1-year course on string theory. It will also be useful for researchers interested in learning about developments in modern string theory.

This fact makes it challenging for academics and the industry to achieve interoperability among blockchains seamlessly. Given this new domain's novelty and potential, we conduct a literature review on blockchain interoperability by collecting 284 papers and 120 grey literature documents, constituting a corpus of 404 documents. From those 404 documents, we systematically analyzed and discussed 102 documents, including peer-reviewed papers and grey literature. Our review classifies studies in three categories: Public Connectors, Blockchain of Blockchains, and Hybrid Connectors. Each category is further divided into sub-categories based on defined criteria. We classify 67 existing solutions in one sub-category using the Blockchain Interoperability Framework, providing a holistic overview of blockchain interoperability. Our findings show that blockchain interoperability has a much broader spectrum than cryptocurrencies and cross-chain asset transfers. Finally, this article discusses supporting technologies, standards, use cases, open challenges, and future research directions, paving the way for research in the area.}

  abstract = {In recent years a considerable amount of work in graphics and geometric optimization used tools based on the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a surface. The applications of the Laplacian include mesh editing, surface smoothing, and shape interpolations among others. However, it has been shown [13, 24, 26] that the popular cotangent approximation schemes do not provide convergent point-wise (or even {$\mathscr{L}$}2) estimates, while many applications rely on point-wise estimation. Existence of such schemes has been an open question [13]. In this paper we propose the first algorithm for approximating the Laplace operator of a surface from a mesh with point-wise convergence guarantees applicable to arbitrary meshed surfaces. We show that for a sufficiently fine mesh over an arbitrary surface, our mesh Laplacian is close to the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the surface at every point of the surface. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is simple and easily imple-mentable. Experimental evidence shows that our algorithm exhibits convergence empirically and compares favorably with cotangent-based methods in providing accurate approximation of the Laplace operator for various meshes.

  abstract = {Based on randomly drawn vectors in a separable Hilbert space, one may construct a k-means clustering scheme by minimizing an empirical squared error. We investigate the risk of such a clustering scheme, defined as the expected squared distance of a random vector X from the set of cluster centers. Our main result states that, for an almost surely bounded , the expected excess clustering risk is O(\textquestiondown 1/n) . Since clustering in high (or even infinite)-dimensional spaces may lead to severe computational problems, we examine the properties of a dimension reduction strategy for clustering based on Johnson-Lindenstrauss-type random projections. Our results reflect a tradeoff between accuracy and computational complexity when one uses k-means clustering after random projection of the data to a low-dimensional space. We argue that random projections work better than other simplistic dimension reduction schemes.}

This evaluation indicates that the source of ionization events within the counters is from alpha particles originating in natural uranium series bulk contamination of the counter materials. This leads to an irreducible minimum background counting rate in the absence of rTeutrons which is characteristic of each individual counter. Measurements on a number of commercial counters gave backgrounds of from 0.005 to 0.05 cpm per square inch of inner surface. Careful materials selection and special processing techniques should reduce this source of background considerably.},

  abstract = {Balanced edge partition has emerged as a new approach to partition an input graph data for the purpose of scaling out parallel computations, which is of interest for several modern data analytics computation platforms, including platforms for iterative computations, machine learning problems, and graph databases. This new approach stands in a stark contrast to the traditional approach of balanced vertex partition, where for given number of partitions, the problem is to minimize the number of edges cut subject to balancing the vertex cardinality of partitions. In this paper, we first characterize the expected costs of vertex and edge partitions with and without aggregation of messages, for the commonly deployed policy of placing a vertex or an edge uniformly at random to one of the partitions. We then obtain the first approximation algorithms for the balanced edge-partition problem which for the case of no aggregation matches the best known approximation ratio for the balanced vertex-partition problem, and show that this remains to hold for the case with aggregation up to factor that is equal to the maximum in-degree of a vertex. We report results of an extensive empirical evaluation on a set of real-world graphs, which quantifies the benefits of edge- vs. vertex-partition, and demonstrates efficiency of natural greedy online assignments for the balanced edge-partition problem with and with no aggregation.},

Recently, heat kernel signature was introduced as an intrinsic local shape descriptor based on diffusion scale-space analysis. In this paper, we develop a scale-invariant version of the heat kernel descriptor. Our construction is based on a logarithmically sampled scale-space in which shape scaling corresponds, up to a multiplicative constant, to a translation. This translation is undone using the magnitude of the Fourier transform. The proposed scale-invariant local descriptors can be used in the bag-of-features framework for shape retrieval in the presence of transformations such as isometric deformations, missing data, topological noise, and global and local scaling. We get significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art algorithms on recently established non-rigid shape retrieval benchmarks.},

  abstract = {Many ellipse detection methods have been proposed for detecting ellipses in images. However, they are unsuitable for industrial images due to low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). This paper presents an ellipse detection method combining the advantages of Hough transform(HT) based methods and the advantages of edge following methods, which is capable of detecting fragmented ellipses and is both computational and memory efficient. Our method works in two steps. In the first step, an edge following method is proposed to quickly and accurately extract the majority of ellipses. For ellipses missed in the first step, candidate regions where each may contain one missed ellipse are extracted in the second step using cluster analysis, and then a HT based method is performed on these regions to extract the missed ellipses. This can not only guarantee the accuracy of the HT based method, but also save the memory and computation time. We test the performance of our method using both synthetic images and low SNR industrial images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs far better than existing methods in terms of recall, precision, F-measure, and reliability. Especially in term of reliability, our method has achieved a very high value close to 1 while the reliabilities of state-of-the art methods are almost less than 0.5.},

(1) A vision-based hardware system for ICLF size detection is designed. (2) Different visual components of the ICLF, including lines and circles, are accurately detected via Hough transformation. (3) With the prior knowledge of the physical size of the camera sensor, the physical size of the ICLF is finally estimated from the accurate detection results. The proposed machine vision-based system reduced the labor cost of the conventional manually based size detection method. Experimental results from real ICLFs show that the physical size error is less than 0.02mm, which verifies the accuracy of our system.},

We deploy this new calibration method to annotate pan-tilt-zoom data from soccer videos. The collected data are used as references for new images. We also propose a fast random forest method to predict pan-tilt angles without image-to-image feature matching, leading to an efficient calibration method for new images. We demonstrate our system on synthetic data and two real soccer datasets. Our two-point approach achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art method.},

We first build an open Jackson queueing network model to capture users' transaction dynamics on shards. Then we cast users' interactions as a shard-based blockchain game, wherein each user aims to minimize its transaction confirmation time and transaction fee. We investigate the equilibrium of the game, and design a polynomial-time algorithm to find efficient equilibria with good system performance. We further design a novel sharding protocol with dynamic user distribution for the permissionless blockchain, and the protocol can maintain good performance in long-term dynamic environment. Extensive numerical results using realistic blockchain transaction data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm and the designed protocol can achieve superior performance for shard-based blockchains.},

Prevalent clustering methods mainly focus on vector or matrix-variate data and are not applicable to general-order tensors, which arise frequently in modern scientific and business applications. Moreover, there is a gap between statistical guarantees and computational efficiency for existing tensor clustering solutions due to the nature of their non-convex formulations. In this work, we bridge this gap by developing a provable convex formulation of tensor co-clustering. Our convex co-clustering (CoCo) estimator enjoys stability guarantees and its computational and storage costs are polynomial in the size of the data. We further establish a non-asymptotic error bound for the CoCo estimator, which reveals a surprising ``blessing of dimensionality'' phenomenon that does not exist in vector or matrix-variate cluster analysis. Our theoretical findings are supported by extensive simulated studies. Finally, we apply the CoCo estimator to the cluster analysis of advertisement click tensor data from a major online company. Our clustering results provide meaningful business insights to improve advertising effectiveness.},

The detector models edge connectivity by line segments and exploits these line segments to construct a set of elliptical-arcs. Disconnected elliptical-arcs which describe the same ellipse are identified and grouped together by incrementally finding optimal pairings of elliptical-arcs. We extract hypothetical ellipses of an image by fitting an ellipse to the elliptical-arcs of each group. Finally, a feedback loop is developed to sieve out low confidence hypothetical ellipses and to regenerate a better set of hypothetical ellipses. In this aspect, the proposed algorithm performs self-correction and homes in on ``difficult'' ellipses. Detailed evaluation on synthetic images shows that the algorithm outperforms existing methods substantially in terms of recall and precision scores under the scenarios of image cluttering, salt-and-pepper noise and partial occlusion. Additionally, we apply the detector on a set of challenging real-world images. Successful detection of ellipses present in these images is demonstrated. We are not aware of any other work that can detect ellipses from such difficult images. Therefore, this work presents a significant contribution towards ellipse detection.},

For tackling the approximate ellipse detection problem, we propose a novel genetic approach which is more robust in handling appearance changes caused by perspective shape deformations and partial occlusions. To deal with the color recognition of each detected traffic light, we propose the design of a spatial texture layout feature which is more effective in handling illumination variations under different weather conditions and eliminating false alarms from irrelevant scene backgrounds. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves an average recognition rate of 95.01\%, with a false alarm rate below 2\% based on 763 3-color traffic lights over 714 testing images, and demonstrates superior performance compared with an existing method.},

  abstract = {Many shape analysis methods treat the geometry of an object as a metric space that can be captured by the Laplace-Beltrami operator. In this paper, we propose to adapt the classical Hamiltonian operator from quantum mechanics to the field of shape analysis. To this end, we study the addition of a potential function to the Laplacian as a generator for dual spaces in which shape processing is performed. We present general optimization approaches for solving variational problems involving the basis defined by the Hamiltonian using perturbation theory for its eigenvectors. The suggested operator is shown to produce better functional spaces to operate with, as demonstrated on different shape analysis tasks.},

  abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most powerful tools in machine learning. The simplest method for PCA, the power iteration, requires \$\textbackslash mathcal O(1/\textbackslash Delta)\$ full-data passes to recover the principal component of a matrix with eigen-gap \$\textbackslash Delta\$. Lanczos, a significantly more complex method, achieves an accelerated rate of \$\textbackslash mathcal O(1/\textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash Delta\})\$ passes. Modern applications, however, motivate methods that only ingest a subset of available data, known as the stochastic setting. In the online stochastic setting, simple algorithms like Oja's iteration achieve the optimal sample complexity \$\textbackslash mathcal O(\textbackslash sigma\^2/\textbackslash Delta\^2)\$. Unfortunately, they are fully sequential, and also require \$\textbackslash mathcal O(\textbackslash sigma\^2/\textbackslash Delta\^2)\$ iterations, far from the \$\textbackslash mathcal O(1/\textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash Delta\})\$ rate of Lanczos. We propose a simple variant of the power iteration with an added momentum term, that achieves both the optimal sample and iteration complexity. In the full-pass setting, standard analysis shows that momentum achieves the accelerated rate, \$\textbackslash mathcal O(1/\textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash Delta\})\$. We demonstrate empirically that naively applying momentum to a stochastic method, does not result in acceleration. We perform a novel, tight variance analysis that reveals the "breaking-point variance" beyond which this acceleration does not occur. By combining this insight with modern variance reduction techniques, we construct stochastic PCA algorithms, for the online and offline setting, that achieve an accelerated iteration complexity \$\textbackslash mathcal O(1/\textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash Delta\})\$. Due to the embarassingly parallel nature of our methods, this acceleration translates directly to wall-clock time if deployed in a parallel environment. Our approach is very general, and applies to many non-convex optimization problems that can now be accelerated using the same technique.},

A novel theoretical formulation views the contingency table as an empirical joint probability distribution of two discrete random variables and poses the co-clustering problem as an optimization problem in information theory \textemdash{} the optimal co-clustering maximizes the mutual information between the clustered random variables subject to constraints on the number of row and column clusters. We present an innovative co-clustering algorithm that monotonically increases the preserved mutual information by intertwining both the row and column clusterings at all stages.

The method adopts arcs selection, smart grouping, and repeated utilization of gradient information to significantly reduce the computations otherwise needed without compromising the detection effectiveness. Geometric properties calculable with few computations, such as arc smoothness, relative placement of curves, and region of confidence for ellipse centres, are utilized for this purpose. An exhaustive sensitivity analysis of the method's control parameters has been performed. It reveals range of values that support consistent performance over diverse challenging datasets with complex background, multiple differently sized ellipses, and occluded, overlapping ellipses. The method's performance is compared with six state-of-the-art detectors over four diverse datasets. Among all the tested methods, the proposed method demonstrates the best balance between detection effectiveness (the best or the second best F-measure scores) and computation time ({$>$}40 Hz) across all the datasets.},

  abstract = {Robotic manipulation employs the object detection in images to create a scene awareness and locate an object's pose. In dynamic scenarios, fast multiobject detection and tracking are crucial. Many objects commonly found in household and industrial environments are represented by cylindrical shapes. Thus, it is available for robots to manipulate them through the real-time detection of elliptic shape primitives formed by the circular tops of these objects. We devise an efficient algorithm of the detection of elliptic shape primitives, which in turn enables robust and real-time robotic manipulations of such objects. The proposed algorithm incorporates the information of elliptic edge curvature, splits complex curves into arcs, classifies the arcs into different quadrants of a candidate elliptic shape, determines the quality of arc selection for ellipse fitting, and then retrieves the corresponding elliptic shape primitive. Our algorithm provides either faster or more accurate ellipse detection results than the current state-of-the-art methods, irrespective of challenging scenarios such as occluded or overlapping ellipses. This is verified by performance comparison with six state-of-the-art elliptic shape detection algorithms on four public image datasets. The algorithm has been integrated on robots to demonstrate the ability to carry out accurate robotic manipulations (tracking, grasping, and stacking) of cylindrical objects in real time. We show that the robotic manipulator, empowered by the elliptic shape primitive algorithm, performs well in complex manipulation experiments as well as dynamic scenarios.},

  abstract = {It is known that Maxwell's electrodynamics\textemdash as usually understood at the present time\textemdash when applied to moving bodies, leads to asymmetries which do not appear to be inherent in the phenomena. Take, for example, the reciprocal electrodynamic action of a magnet and a conductor. The observable phenomenon here depends only on the relative motion of the conductor and the magnet, whereas the customary view draws a sharp distinction between the two cases in which either the one or the other of these bodies is in motion. For if the magnet is in motion and the conductor at rest, there arises in the neighbourhood of the magnet an electric field with a certain definite energy, producing a current at the places where parts of the conductor are situated. But if the magnet is stationary and the conductor in motion, no electric field arises in the neighbourhood of the magnet. In the conductor, however, we find an electromotive force, to which in itself there is no corresponding energy, but which gives rise\textemdash assuming equality of relative motion in the two cases discussed\textemdash to electric currents of the same path and intensity as those produced by the electric forces in the former case.  Examples of this sort, together with the unsuccessful attempts to discover any motion of the earth relatively to the ``light medium,'' suggest that the phenomena of electrodynamics as well as of mechanics possess no properties corresponding to the idea of absolute rest. They suggest rather that, as has already been shown to the first order of small quantities, the same laws of electrodynamics and optics will be valid for all frames of reference for which the equations of mechanics hold good.1 We will raise this conjecture (the purport of which will hereafter be called the ``Principle of Relativity'') to the status of a postulate, and also introduce another postulate, which is only apparently irreconcilable with the former, namely, that light is always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity c which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body. These two postulates suffice for the attainment of a simple and consistent theory of the electrodynamics of moving bodies based on Maxwell's theory for stationary bodies. The introduction of a ``luminiferous ether'' will prove to be superfluous inasmuch as the view here to be developed will not require an ``absolutely stationary space'' provided with special properties, nor assign a velocity-vector to a point of the empty space in which electromagnetic processes take place.  The theory to be developed is based\textemdash like all electrodynamics\textemdash on the kinematics of the rigid body, since the assertions of any such theory have to do with the relationships between rigid bodies (systems of co-ordinates), clocks, and electromagnetic processes. Insufficient consideration of this circumstance lies at the root of the difficulties which the electrodynamics of moving bodies at present encounters.},

Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

This motivates the present investigation aiming to develop an automatic system capable of performing that task. The system developed consists of a pre-processing stage where a vectorial field is calculated using an optical flow algorithm with one SST map and a matrix of zeros for input. Next, a binary image of the modulus of the vectorial field is created using an iterative thresholding algorithm. Finally, five edge points of the binary image, classified according to their gradient vector direction, are randomly selected and an ellipse corresponding to a water eddy fitted to them.},

The proposed algorithm relies on an innovative selection strategy of arcs which are candidate to form ellipses and on the use of Hough transform to estimate parameters in a decomposed space. The final aim of this solution is to represent a building block for new generation of smart-phone applications which need fast and accurate ellipse detection also with limited computational resources.},

The ERD model is a recurrent neural network that incorporates nonlinear encoder and decoder networks before and after recurrent layers. We test instantiations of ERD architectures in the tasks of motion capture (mocap) generation, body pose labeling and body pose forecasting in videos. Our model handles mocap training data across multiple subjects and activity domains, and synthesizes novel motions while avoiding drifting for long periods of time. For human pose labeling, ERD outperforms a per frame body part detector by resolving left-right body part confusions. For video pose forecasting, ERD predicts body joint displacements across a temporal horizon of 400ms and outperforms a first order motion model based on optical flow. ERDs extend previous Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models in the literature to jointly learn representations and their dynamics. Our experiments show such representation learning is crucial for both labeling and prediction in space-time. We find this is a distinguishing feature between the spatio-temporal visual domain in comparison to 1D text, speech or handwriting, where straightforward hard coded representations have shown excellent results when directly combined with recurrent units [31] .},

In this paper, we consider the case of producing block-diagonal biclusters. We provide a new formulation of the biclustering problem based on the idea of minimizing the empirical clustering risk. We develop and prove a consistency result with respect to the empirical clustering risk. Since the optimization problem is combinatorial in nature, finding the global minimum is computationally intractable. In light of this fact, we propose a simple and novel algorithm that finds a local minimum by alternating the use of an adapted version of the k-means clustering algorithm between columns and rows. We evaluate and compare the performance of our algorithm to other related biclustering methods on both simulated data and real-world gene expression data sets. The results demonstrate that our algorithm is able to detect meaningful structures in the data and outperform other competing biclustering methods in various settings and situations.},

In the past, algorithms have been given which fit circles and ellipses in some least-squares sense without minimizing the geometric distance to the given points. In this paper we present several algorithms which compute the ellipse for which the sum of the squares of the distances to the given points is minimal. These algorithms are compared with classical simple and iterative methods. Circles and ellipses may be represented algebraically, i.e., by an equation of the form F(x)=0. If a point is on the curve, then its coordinates x are a zero of the function F. Alternatively, curves may be represented in parametric form, which is well suited for minimizing the sum of the squares of the distances. \textcopyright{} 1994 the BIT Foundation.},

The convergence guarantees and statistical optimality are established for the proposed procedure under a mild sub-Gaussian noise assumption. Under the Gaussian tensor block model, we completely characterize the statistical-computational trade-off for achieving high-order exact clustering based on three different signal-to-noise ratio regimes. The analysis relies on new techniques of high-order spectral perturbation analysis and a "singular-value-gap-free" error bound in tensor estimation, which are substantially different from the matrix spectral analyses in the literature. Finally, we show the merits of the proposed procedures via extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets.},

Today we know that minimal triangulations are closely related to minimal separators of the input graph. Since the first papers presenting minimal triangulation algorithms appeared in 1976, several characterizations of minimal triangulations have been proved, and a variety of algorithms exist for computing minimal triangulations of both general and restricted graph classes.

However, such accuracy is not easily attained due to various error sources that can affect the image formation process. Current calibration methods typically assume that the observations are unbiased, the only error is the zero-mean independent and identically distributed random noise in the observed image coordinates, and the camera model completely explains the mapping between the 3D coordinates and the image coordinates. in general, these conditions are not met, causing the calibration results to be less accurate than expected. In this paper, a calibration procedure for precise 3D computer vision applications is described. It introduces bias correction for circular control points and a nonrecursive method for reversing the distortion model. The accuracy analysis is presented and the error sources that can reduce the theoretical accuracy are discussed. The tests with synthetic images indicate improvements in the calibration results in limited error conditions. In real images, the suppression of external error sources becomes a prerequisite for successful calibration.},

We adopt a model for airborne transmission risk in an enclosed room that considers room properties, mask efficiency, and initial infection probability of the occupants. Additionally, we study the effect of vaccination on the spread of the virus. The presented model has been evaluated in simulations using fall 2019 (prepandemic) and fall 2020 (hybrid instruction) course registration data of a large US university, allowing for assessing the difference in transmission risk between in-person and hybrid programs and the impact of occupancy reduction, mask-wearing, and vaccination. The simulations indicate that without vaccination, moving 90\% of the classes online leads to a 17 to 18\texttimes{} reduction in new cases, and universal mask usage results in an {$\sim$}2.7 to 3.6\texttimes{} reduction in new infections through classroom interactions. Furthermore, the results indicate that for the original variant and using vaccines with efficacy greater than 90\%, at least 23\% (64\%) of students need to be vaccinated with (without) mask usage in order to operate the university at full occupancy while preventing an increase in cases due to classroom interactions. For the more contagious variant, even with universal mask usage, at least 93\% of the students need to be vaccinated to ensure the same conditions. We show that the model is able to predict trends observed in weekly infection rates for fall 2021.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Biclustering of transcriptomic data groups genes and samples simultaneously. It is emerging as a standard tool for extracting knowledge from gene expression measurements. We propose a novel generative approach for biclustering called `FABIA: Factor Analysis for Bicluster Acquisition'. FABIA is based on a multiplicative model, which accounts for linear dependencies between gene expression and conditions, and also captures heavy-tailed distributions as observed in real-world transcriptomic data. The generative framework allows to utilize well-founded model selection methods and to apply Bayesian techniques.Results: On 100 simulated datasets with known true, artificially implanted biclusters, FABIA clearly outperformed all 11 competitors. On these datasets, FABIA was able to separate spurious biclusters from true biclusters by ranking biclusters according to their information content. FABIA was tested on three microarray datasets with known subclusters, where it was two times the best and once the second best method among the compared biclustering approaches.Availability: FABIA is available as an R package on Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org).

  abstract = {A body sensor network (BSN) is typically a wearable wireless sensor network. Security protection is critical to BSNs, since they collect sensitive personal information. Generally speaking, security protection of BSN relies on identity (ID) and key distribution protocols. Most existing protocols are designed to run in general wireless sensor networks, and are not suitable for BSNs. After carefully examining the characteristics of BSNs, the authors propose human interactive empirical channel-based security protocols, which include an elliptic curve Diffie\textendash Hellman version of symmetric hash commitment before knowledge protocol and an elliptic curve Diffie\textendash Hellman version of hash commitment before knowledge protocol. Using these protocols, dynamically distributing keys and IDs become possible. As opposite to present solutions, these protocols do not need any pre-deployment of keys or secrets. Therefore compromised and expired keys or IDs can be easily changed. These protocols exploit human users as temporary trusted third parties. The authors, thus, show that the human interactive channels can help them to design secure BSNs.},

However, there are few researches on the properties of the common self-polar triangle, especially when the two planar conics are special conics. In this paper, we explore the properties of the common self-polar triangle, when the two conics happen to be concentric circles. We show there exist infinite many common self-polar triangles of two concentric circles, and provide a method to locate the vertices of these triangles. By investigating all these triangles, we find that they encode two important properties. The first one is all triangles share one common vertex, and the opposite side of the common vertex lies on the same line, which are the circle center and the line at the infinity of the support plane. The second is all triangles are right triangles. Based on these two properties, the imaged circle center and the varnishing line of support plane can be recovered simultaneously, and many conjugate pairs on vanishing line can be obtained. These allow to induce good constraints on the image of absolute conic. We evaluate two calibration algorithms, whereby accurate results are achieved. The main contribution of this paper is that we initiate a new perspective to look into circle-based camera calibration problem. We believe that other calibration methods using different circle patterns can benefit from this perspective, especially for the patterns which involve more than two circles.},

We find that any two ellipses have a unique common self-polar triangle, which can provide three line correspondences. Furthermore, by investigating the location features of the common self-polar triangle, we show that one vertex of the triangle lies outside of both ellipses, while the other two vertices lies inside the ellipses separately. Accordingly, one more line correspondence can be obtained from the intersections of the conics and the common self-polar triangle. Therefore, four line correspondences can be obtained based on the common self-polar triangle, which can provide enough constraints for the homography estimation. The main contributions in this paper include: (1) A new discovery on the location features of the common self-polar triangle of separate ellipses. (2) A novel approach for homography estimation. Simulate experiments and real experiments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of our approach.},

We also introduce a replication algorithm that is tightly integrated with the partitioning algorithm, which further reduces the number of edges cut by the partitioning algorithm. Even though the proposed approach is handicapped by only taking into consideration local parts of the graph when reassigning vertices, extensive evaluation shows that the proposed approach maintains a quality partitioning over time, which is comparable at any point in time to performing a full partitioning from scratch using a state-the-art static graph partitioning algorithm such as METIS. Furthermore, when vertex replication is turned on, edge-cut can improve by an order of magnitude.},

However, in recent years much progress has been made in these areas. In this review we discuss ideas for the efficient implementation of the HT and present results on the analytic and empirical performance of various methods. We also report the relationship of Hough methods and other transforms and consider applications in which the HT has been used. It seems likely that the HT will be an increasingly used technique and we hope that this survey will provide a useful guide to quickly acquaint researchers with the main literature in this research area. \textcopyright{} 1988 Academic Press, Inc.

  abstract = {Detecting elliptical objects from an image is a central task in robot navigation and industrial diagnosis, where the detection time is always a critical issue. Existing methods are hardly applicable to these real-time scenarios of limited hardware resource due to the huge number of fragment candidates (edges or arcs) for fitting ellipse equations. In this paper, we present a fast algorithm detecting ellipses with high accuracy. The algorithm leverages a newly developed projective invariant to significantly prune the undesired candidates and to pick out elliptical ones. The invariant is able to reflect the intrinsic geometry of a planar curve, giving the value of -1 on any three collinear points and +1 for any six points on an ellipse. Thus, we apply the pruning and picking by simply comparing these binary values. Moreover, the calculation of the invariant only involves the determinant of a \$3\textbackslash times 3\$ matrix. Extensive experiments on three challenging data sets with 648 images demonstrate that our detector runs 20\%-50\% faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms with the comparable or higher precision.},

We begin by the fast extraction of smooth arcs from the edge map, followed by the construction of a directed graph and a disjoint-set forest, whereby the arc relationships are effectively encoded to enhance the arc grouping process. Compared with representative approaches such as the depth-first search, the disjoint-set forest enables complete grouping of arcs to generate candidate ellipses. Moreover, it merely has linear memory complexity and constant access time, hence guarantees fast detection. To boost precision and remove false positives, we propose to project the candidate ellipses onto the original image, to align the gradients of ellipses and the image pixels. We also vectorize the elliptical parameters to depress duplicated candidates. We perform extensive experiments on both synthetic and challenging real-world datasets, to show that our detector is accurate and efficient, as well as versatile in many practical tasks.

Our method, which we call HyperLS, relies on algebraic distance minimization with a carefully chosen scale normalization. The normalization is derived using a rigorous error analysis of least squares (LS) estimators so that statistical bias is eliminated up to second order noise terms. Numerical evidence suggests that the proposed HyperLS estimator is far superior to the standard LS and is slightly better than the Taubin estimator. Although suboptimal in comparison to maximum likelihood (ML), our HyperLS does not require iterations. Hence, it does not suffer from convergence issues due to poor initialization, which is inherent in ML estimators. In this sense, the proposed HyperLS is a perfect candidate for initializing the ML iterations. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This is because circular objects, which are very common in daily scenes, are projected as ellipses in images. We can even compute their 3D positions from the fitted ellipse equations, which along with other applications are discussed in Chap. 9. In this chapter, we present computational procedures for accurately fitting an ellipse to extracted edge points by considering the statistical properties of image noise. The approach is classified into algebraic and geometric. The algebraic approach includes least squares, iterative reweight, the Taubin method, renormalization, HyperLS, and hyper-renormalization; the geometric approach includes FNS, geometric distance minimization, and hyper-accurate correction. We then describe the ellipse-specific method of Fitzgibbon et al. and the random sampling technique for avoiding hyperbolas, which may occur when the input information is insufficient. The RANSAC procedure is also discussed for removing nonelliptic arcs from the extracted edge point sequence.},

  abstract = {Recently, a number of researchers have investigated a class of graph partitioning algorithms that reduce the size of the graph by collapsing vertices and edges, partition the smaller graph, and then uncoarsen it to construct a partition for the original graph [Bui and Jones, Proc. of the 6th SIAM Conference on Parallel Processing for Scientific Computing, 1993, 445--452; Hendrickson and Leland, A Multilevel Algorithm for Partitioning Graphs, Tech. report SAND 93-1301, Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM, 1993]. From the early work it was clear that multilevel techniques held great promise; however, it was not knownif they can be made to consistently produce high quality partitions for graphs arising in a wide range of application domains. We investigate the effectiveness of many different choices for all three phases: coarsening, partition of the coarsest graph, and refinement. In particular, we present a new coarsening heuristic (called heavy-edge heuristic) for which the size of the partition of the coarse graph is within a small factor of the size of the final partition obtained after multilevel refinement. We also present a much faster variation of the Kernighan--Lin (KL) algorithm for refining during uncoarsening. We test our scheme on a large number of graphs arising in various domains including finite element methods, linear programming, VLSI, and transportation. Our experiments show that our scheme produces partitions that are consistently better than those produced by spectral partitioning schemes in substantially smaller time. Also, when our scheme is used to compute fill-reducing orderings for sparse matrices, it produces orderings that have substantially smaller fill than the widely used multiple minimum degree algorithm.},

  abstract = {Bitcoin is a virtual currency based on a transaction-ledger database called blockchain. The blockchain is maintained and updated by mining process in which a number of nodes called miners compete for finding answers of very difficult puzzle-like problem. Transactions issued by users are grouped into a block, and the block is added to the blockchain when an algorithmic puzzle specialized for the block is solved. A recent study reveals that newly arriving transactions are not included in the block being under mining. In this paper, we model the mining process with a queueing system with batch service, analyzing the transaction-confirmation time. We consider an \$\$M/\textbackslash text\{ G \}\^B/1\$\$M/GB/1with batch service, in which a newly arriving transaction cannot enter the service facility even when the number of transactions in the service facility does not reach the maximum batch size, i.e., the block-size limit. In this model, the sojourn time of a transaction corresponds to its confirmation time. We consider the joint distribution of the number of transactions in system and the elapsed service time, deriving the mean transaction-confirmation time. In numerical examples, we show how the block-size limit affects the transaction-confirmation time.},

The intelligent ability to learn these non-verbal cues of the humans is the key characteristic to develop efficient human computer interaction systems. Extracting an effective representation from facial expression images is a crucial step that impacts the recognition accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel feature selection strategy using singular value decomposition (SVD) based co-clustering to search for the most salient regions in terms of facial features that possess a high discriminating ability among all expressions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first known attempt to explicitly perform co-clustering in the facial expression recognition domain. In our method, Gabor filters are used to extract local features from an image and then discriminant features are selected based on the class membership in co-clusters. Experiments demonstrate that co-clustering localizes the salient regions of the face image. Not only does the procedure reduce the dimensionality but also improves the recognition accuracy. Experiments on CK plus, JAFFE and MMI databases validate the existence and effectiveness of these learned facial features.},

  abstract = {Global analyses of RNA expression levels are useful for classifying genes and overall phenotypes. Often these classification problems are linked, and one wants to find ``marker genes'' that are differentially expressed in particular sets of ``conditions.'' We have developed a method that simultaneously clusters genes and conditions, finding distinctive ``checkerboard'' patterns in matrices of gene expression data, if they exist. In a cancer context, these checkerboards correspond to genes that are markedly up- or downregulated in patients with particular types of tumors. Our method, spectral biclustering, is based on the observation that checkerboard structures in matrices of expression data can be found in eigenvectors corresponding to characteristic expression patterns across genes or conditions. In addition, these eigenvectors can be readily identified by commonly used linear algebra approaches, in particular the singular value decomposition (SVD), coupled with closely integrated normalization steps. We present a number of variants of the approach, depending on whether the normalization over genes and conditions is done independently or in a coupled fashion. We then apply spectral biclustering to a selection of publicly available cancer expression data sets, and examine the degree to which the approach is able to identify checkerboard structures. Furthermore, we compare the performance of our biclustering methods against a number of reasonable benchmarks (e.g., direct application of SVD or normalized cuts to raw data).},

Two particular tensor decompositions can be considered to be higher-order extensions of the matrix singular value decomposition: CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposes a tensor as a sum of rank-one tensors, and the Tucker decomposition is a higher-order form of principal component analysis. There are many other tensor decompositions, including INDSCAL, PARAFAC2, CANDELINC, DEDICOM, and PARATUCK2 as well as nonnegative variants of all of the above. The N-way Toolbox, Tensor Toolbox, and Multilinear Engine are examples of software packages for working with tensors.},

  abstract = {Blockchain has many benefits including decentralization, availability, persistency, consistency, anonymity, auditability and accountability, and it also covers a wide spectrum of applications ranging from cryptocurrency, financial services, reputation system, Internet of Things, sharing economy to public and social services. Not only may blockchain be regarded as a by-product of Bitcoin cryptocurrency systems, but also it is a type of distributed ledger technologies through using a trustworthy, decentralized log of totally ordered transactions. By summarizing the literature of blockchain, it is found that more and more important research is to develop basic theory, for example, mathematical models (Markov processes, queueing theory and game models) for mining management and consensus mechanism, performance analysis and optimization of blockchain systems. In this paper, we develop queueing theory of blockchain systems and provide system performance evaluation. To do this, we design a Markovian batch-service queueing system with two different service stages, which are suitable to well express the mining process in the miners pool and the building of a new blockchain. By using the matrix-geometric solution, we obtain a system stable condition and express three key performance measures: (a) The average number of transactions in the queue, (b) the average number of transactions in a block, and (c) the average transaction-confirmation time. Finally, we use numerical examples to verify computability of our theoretical results. Although our queueing model here is simple only under exponential or Poisson assumptions, our analytic method will open a series of potentially promising research in queueing theory of blockchain systems.},

  abstract = {Ellipse shapes taken by a projection lens encode rich semantic information, and ellipse detection is an important and convenient means to obtain spatial semantics from images. However, accurate and robust detectors for real-world images remain challenging. In this article, a shape-biased ellipse detection network with an auxiliary task is proposed to fulfill this requirement, which can learn and characterize low-level features more effectively. Our multitask-based architecture simultaneously performs elliptical bounding box detection, edge prediction, and parameter regression. First, since ellipses are represented as a set of arcs, we enhance the contact between low-level features and high-level features to better retain structural information. Second, ellipse edge prediction as an auxiliary task drives the backbone biased to ellipse shapes rather than others and makes more efficient use of limited datasets. In addition, by modeling the ellipse as a 2-D Gaussian distribution, Wasserstein distance is used as the loss function to minimize the distance between two Gaussian distributions. Experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed EllipseNet achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods. Extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed backbone module and auxiliary branch.},

It has been repeatedly shown that these methods can be useful for dealing with a wide range of structural geometries, even those for which the assumption is only approximately valid, e.g. structures produced by the interference of superimposed fold sets. In some instances though, such as in the analysis of oil-field structures, it is the presence and type of non-cylindricity in a structure which is of primary interest. The description of such folded surfaces requires more general methods of analyzing surface curvature based on the principles of differential geometry. The Mohr circle construction, already familiar to structural geologists in the context of stress and strain, is shown to be useful for the analysis of surface curvature and torsion. A practical method of mapping principal curvatures and their trajectories, involving the application of the Mohr circle, is described and applied, by way of example, for the survey of the Goose Egg Dome in Wyoming and a small-scale fold from Laksefjord, Norway.},

The key area of difficulty is on distinguishing the pixels pertaining to each target in the presence of noise. To tackle with the issue, we propose a hierarchical approach which is motivated by the fact that any segment of an ellipse can identify itself in ellipse reconstruction. First, we find all the neat edges without any branches, followed by an ellipse fitting on each of them. Second, some target candidates are estimated based on the neat edges, by a proposed grouping strategy. Finally, the targets are detected based on the candidates, by a proposed selective competitive algorithm to distinguish the true pixels of each target. A real application of the proposed method is illustrated in addition to some other demonstrative experiments. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {A fast and precise method for ellipse detection is proposed in this paper. The method aims at clearly removing the lines and curves which are not ellipse edges to improve the ellipse fitting. In arc extraction, the arcs are divided into four categories according to the gradient, and the size constraint is exploited to remove the interference lines. Then, the arc relative position constraints and the tangent lines constraint are employed to exactly group the arcs that belong to the same ellipse into a set. Finally, a post-processing approach is developed to remove the invalid ellipses. Due to the effective removal of the interference edges and the designed geometric multi-constraint, the computational costs of arc grouping and parameter estimation are dramatically reduced, and the fitting results are finely agreeable to the actual ellipse contours. The performance is evaluated with 3600 synthetic images and 1517 real images, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method runs much faster than the current speed leading methods with the comparable or higher F-measure.},

Each couple of line segments is analyzed to form a valid pair and followed by generating initial circle set. Through the mean shift clustering, the circle candidates are generated and verified based on the geometric attributes of circle edge. Finally, twice circle fitting is applied to increase the accuracy for circle locating and radius measuring. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than other well known approaches on circles that are incomplete, occluded, blurry and over-illumination.

In this paper, we propose a valuable industry-oriented ellipse detector by arc-support line segments, which simultaneously reaches high detection accuracy and efficiency. To simplify the complicated curves in an image while retaining the general properties including convexity and polarity, the arc-support line segments are extracted, which grounds the successful detection of ellipses. The arc-support groups are formed by iteratively and robustly linking the arc-support line segments that latently belong to a common ellipse. Afterward, two complementary approaches, namely, locally selecting the arc-support group with higher saliency and globally searching all the valid paired groups, are adopted to fit the initial ellipses in a fast way. Then, the ellipse candidate set can be formulated by hierarchical clustering of 5D parameter space of initial ellipses. Finally, the salient ellipse candidates are selected and refined as detections subject to the stringent and effective verification. Extensive experiments on three public datasets are implemented and our method achieves the best F-measure scores compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Therefore, it is challenging to securely implement data aggregation and power dispatching in microgrids without any trusted third party. In this paper, by leveraging blockchain, we propose secure data aggregation based on homomorphic encryption and the PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) consensus, and meanwhile we propose automatic power dispatching by utilizing the PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) algorithm and smart contracts.

  abstract = {This manuscript presents a new method for fitting ellipses to two-dimensional data using the confocal hyperbola approximation to the geometric distance of points to ellipses. The proposed method was evaluated and compared to established methods on simulated and real-world datasets. First, it was revealed that the confocal hyperbola distance considerably outperforms other distance approximations such as algebraic and Sampson. Next, the proposed ellipse fitting method was compared with five reliable and established methods proposed by Halir, Taubin, Kanatani, Ahn and Szpak. The performance of each method as a function of rotation, aspect ratio, noise, and arc-length were examined. It was observed that the proposed ellipse fitting method achieved almost identical results (and in some cases better) than the gold standard geometric method of Ahn and outperformed the remaining methods in all simulation experiments. Finally, the proposed method outperformed the considered ellipse fitting methods in estimating the geometric parameters of cylindrical mechanical pipes from point clouds. The results of the experiments show that the confocal hyperbola is an excellent approximation to the true geometric distance and produces reliable and accurate ellipse fitting in practical settings.},

However, the results from the application of standard clustering methods to genes are limited. This limitation is imposed by the existence of a number of experimental conditions where the activity of genes is uncorrelated. A similar limitation exists when clustering of conditions is performed. For this reason, a number of algorithms that perform simultaneous clustering on the row and column dimensions of the data matrix has been proposed. The goal is to find submatrices, that is, subgroups of genes and subgroups of conditions, where the genes exhibit highly correlated activities for every condition. In this paper, we refer to this class of algorithms as biclustering. Biclustering is also referred in the literature as coclustering and direct clustering, among others names, and has also been used in fields such as information retrieval and data mining. In this comprehensive survey, we analyze a large number of existing approaches to biclustering, and classify them in accordance with the type of biclusters they can find, the patterns of biclusters that are discovered, the methods used to perform the search, the approaches used to evaluate the solution, and the target applications.},

At the lowest level, the image is described as a set of edge pixels, from which line segments are extracted. Then, line segments that are potential candidates of elliptic arcs are linked to form arc segments according to connectivity and curvature conditions. Next, arc segments that belong to the same ellipse are grouped together. Finally, a robust statistical method, namely RANSAC, is applied to fit ellipses to groups of arc segments. Unlike Hough Transform based algorithms, this method does not need a high dimensional parameter space, and so it reduces the computation and storage requirements. Experiments on both synthetic and real images demonstrate that the proposed method has excellent performance in handling occlusion and overlapping ellipses.},

  abstract = {Fast and accurate ellipse detection is critical in certain computer vision tasks. In this paper, we propose an arc adjacency matrix-based ellipse detection (AAMED) method to fulfill this requirement. At first, after segmenting the edges into elliptic arcs, the digraph-based arc adjacency matrix (AAM) is constructed to describe their triple sequential adjacency states. Curvature and region constraints are employed to make the AAM sparse. Secondly, through bidirectionally searching the AAM, we can get all arc combinations which are probably true ellipse candidates. The cumulative-factor (CF) based cumulative matrices (CM) are worked out simultaneously. CF is irrelative to the image context and can be pre-calculated. CM is related to the arcs or arc combinations and can be calculated by the addition or subtraction of CF. Then the ellipses are efficiently fitted from these candidates through twice eigendecomposition of CM using Jacobi method. Finally, a comprehensive validation score is proposed to eliminate false ellipses effectively. The score is mainly influenced by the constraints about adaptive shape, tangent similarity, distribution compensation. Experiments show that our method outperforms the 12 state-of-the-art methods on 9 datasets as a whole, with reference to recall, precision, F-measure, and time-consumption.},

We further show that structural properties of the visibility graphs can be used to quantify pavement cell shape complexity and allow for classification of plants into their respective phylogenetic clades. Therefore, the visibility graphs provide a robust and unique framework to accurately quantify and classify the shape of different objects.},

  abstract = {Co-clustering is a generalization of unsupervised clustering that has recently drawn renewed attention, driven by emerging data mining applications in diverse areas. Whereas clustering groups entire columns of a data matrix, co-clustering groups columns over select rows only, i.e., it simultaneously groups rows and columns. The concept generalizes to data ``boxes'' and higher-way tensors, for simultaneous grouping along multiple modes. Various co-clustering formulations have been proposed, but no workhorse analogous to K-means has emerged. This paper starts from K-means and shows how co-clustering can be formulated as a constrained multilinear decomposition with sparse latent factors. For three- and higher-way data, uniqueness of the multilinear decomposition implies that, unlike matrix co-clustering, it is possible to unravel a large number of possibly overlapping co-clusters. A basic multi-way co-clustering algorithm is proposed that exploits multilinearity using Lasso-type coordinate updates. Various line search schemes are then introduced to speed up convergence, and suitable modifications are proposed to deal with missing values. The imposition of latent sparsity pays a collateral dividend: it turns out that sequentially extracting one co-cluster at a time is almost optimal, hence the approach scales well for large datasets. The resulting algorithms are benchmarked against the state-of-art in pertinent simulations, and applied to measured data, including the ENRON e-mail corpus.},

  abstract = {The classification of deformable protein shapes, based solely on their macromolecular surfaces, is a challenging problem in protein\textendash protein interaction prediction and protein design. Shape classification is made difficult by the fact that proteins are dynamic, flexible entities with high geometrical complexity. In this paper, we introduce a novel description for such deformable shapes. This description is based on the bifractional Fokker\textendash Planck and Dirac\textendash Ka\textasciidieresis{} hler equations. These equations analyse and probe protein shapes in terms of a scalar, vectorial and non-commuting quaternionic field, allowing for a more comprehensive description of the protein shapes. An underlying non-Markovian Le\textasciiacute{} vy random walk establishes geometrical relationships between distant regions while recalling previous analyses. Classification is performed with a multiobjective deep hierarchical pyramidal neural network, thus performing a multilevel analysis of the description. Our approach is applied to the SHREC'19 dataset for deformable protein shapes classification and to the SHREC'16 dataset for deformable partial shapes classification, demonstrating the effectiveness and generality of our approach.},

Most of biclustering approaches use a measure or cost function that determines the quality of biclusters. In such cases, the development of both a suitable heuristics and a good measure for guiding the search are essential for discovering interesting biclusters in an expression matrix. Nevertheless, not all existing biclustering approaches base their search on evaluation measures for biclusters. There exists a diverse set of biclustering tools that follow different strategies and algorithmic concepts which guide the search towards meaningful results. In this paper we present a extensive survey of biclustering approaches, classifying them into two categories according to whether or not use evaluation metrics within the search method: biclustering algorithms based on evaluation measures and non metric-based biclustering algorithms. In both cases, they have been classified according to the type of meta-heuristics which they are based on.},

Thus, an analytical expression of the maximum deviation of the pixels from the digital line can be derived. Using this, the conventional line fitting methods that use maximum tolerable deviation as the optimization goal can be made control-parameter independent. This error bound can be used to make the most recent and sophisticated line fitting methods parameter independent and more robust to digitization noises. In our knowledge, this is the first line fitting method completely devoid of any control parameter. Such control-parameter independent line fitting algorithm retains the characteristics of the digital curve with sufficient reliability and precision and provides good dimensionality reduction in representing the digital curves. Extensive results have been generated for 9 datasets comprising of about a hundred thousand images. The proposed method shows robust and repeatable performance across all the datasets with low standard deviation in the performance.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel ellipse detection method for real images. The proposed method uses the information of edge curvature and their convexity in relation to other edge contours as clues for identifying edge contours that can be grouped together. A search region is computed for every edge contour that contains other edge contours eligible for grouping with the current edge contour. A two-dimensional Hough transform is performed in an intermediate step, in which we use a new 'relationship score' for ranking the edge contours in a group, instead of the conventional histogram count. The score is found to be more selective and thus more efficient. In addition, we use three novel saliency criteria, that are non-heuristic and consider various aspects for quantifying the goodness of the detected elliptic hypotheses and finally selecting good elliptic hypotheses. The thresholds for selection of elliptic hypotheses are determined by the detected hypotheses themselves, such that the selection is free from human intervention. The method requires a few seconds in most cases. So, it is suitable for practical applications. The performance of the proposed ellipse detection method has been tested on a dataset containing 1200 synthetic images and the Caltech 256 dataset containing real images. In both cases, the results show that the proposed ellipse detection method performs far better than existing methods and is close to the ideal results, with precision, recall, and F-measure, all very close to 1. Further, the method is robust to the increase in the complexity of the images (such as overlapping ellipses, occluded ellipses), while the performance of the contemporary methods deteriorates significantly. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Subjective contours or illusory contours are an important aspect of human perception. Along subjective contours, image contrast is very weak or completely missing, so that no local edge detector can recover them. Their perception is induced by the presence of small pieces of edges and of tips of other long edges incident on the contour. Indeed, in real-world images, edge information of foreground objects is often partly missing due to poor contrast of the object with respect to its background. Nevertheless, the object contour is still perceived by the presence of object or background details that end up abruptly along the contour. In this paper, we handle the detection of straight subjective contours (SSC), using an a contrario approach to control the false detection rate. The algorithm exploits the tips of line segments produced by the well-known parameter-less LSD method. The subjective straight contours are obtained by grouping free tips of parallel line sets, together with aligned short edge pieces. This detection is fully automatic and is demonstrated on a set of images containing subjective contours.},

This capability is shown to reduce the experimental uncertainties of the estimated parameters. The systematic errors caused by the two different acquisition channels are measured and taken into account.

Our method is a one step NFA clustering solution which considers grey-level and spatial density information in one background model. The proposed method is robust to noise and avoids parameter tuning and any assumption about the quantity of the worn-out areas. We have used as input UV induced fluorescence (UVIFL) images for considering details not perceivable with visible light. Tests were conducted on image sequences included in the ``Violins UVIFL imagery'' dataset. Results illustrate the ability of the algorithm to distinguish the worn area from the surrounding regions.

Setting A + C = 1 produces more eccentric conics, resulting either in over-elongated ellipses or hyperbolae. Although the F = 1 normalisation is less well suited than the A + C = 1 normalisation with respect to singularities and transformational invariance both these problems are solved by normalising the data, shifting it so that it is centred on the origin before shifting fitting, and then re-expressing the fit in the original frame of reference.},

Such data is useful for supervised learning and quantitative evaluation. To achieve this, we developed a web-based tool that allows easy image annotation and instant sharing of such annotations. Using this annotation tool, we have collected a large dataset that spans many object categories, often containing multiple instances over a wide variety of images. We quantify the contents of the dataset and compare against existing state of the art datasets used for object recognition and detection. Also, we show how to extend the dataset to automatically enhance object labels with WordNet, discover object parts, recover a depth ordering of objects in a scene, and increase the number of labels using minimal user supervision and images from the web.},

  abstract = {Quantifying cell morphology is fundamental to the statistical study of cell populations, and can help unravel mechanisms underlying cell and tissue morphogenesis. Current methods, however, require extensive human intervention, are highly parameter sensitive, or produce metrics difficult to interpret biologically. We therefore developed a method, Lobe Contribution Elliptical Fourier Analysis (LOCO-EFA), which generates from digitalised 2D cell outlines meaningful descriptors that can be directly matched to morphological features. This is shown by studying well-defined geometric shapes as well as actual biological cells from plant and animal tissues. LOCO-EFA provides a tool to phenotype efficiently and objectively populations of cells, here demonstrated by applying it to the complex shaped pavement cells of Arabidopsis thaliana wild type and speechless leaves, and Drosophila amnioserosa cells. To validate our method's applicability on large populations, we analysed computer-generated tissues. By controlling in silico cell shape, we explored the potential impact of cell packing on individual cell shape, quantifying through LOCO-EFA deviations between the specified shape of single cells in isolation and the resultant shape when they interact within a confluent tissue.},

In this paper a new algorithm to measure the ellipticity of steel coils using a machine vision system is presented. Traditional algorithms for ellipse detection based on least squares fitting can not be directly applied to this problem, since they lead to ellipses with a very high ellipticity if the amount of fitting data is small. In our new concentric ellipse fitting least squares algorithm the additional information, that the elliptic input curves are concentric, is used to increase the amount of available input data, to estimate the ellipticity even if the curve segments are very short. In this paper the results of a traditional ellipse fitting algorithm are compared to those of the new concentric ellipse fitting algorithm. Furthermore the preprocessing tasks (Hough transform, edge detection, curve filtering), which lead to the fitting data, are described in detail. Finally a simulation of the radius dependency of the ellipticity is done, which is compared to the results of the algorithm.},

Here we develop a computational model for cell motion that uses the phase-field method to solve for the moving boundary with physical membrane properties. It includes a reaction-diffusion model for the actin-myosin machinery and discrete adhesion sites which can be in a "gripping" or "slipping" mode and integrates the adhesion dynamics with the dynamics of the actin filaments, modeled as a viscous network. To test this model, we apply it to fish keratocytes, fast moving cells that maintain their morphology, and show that we are able to reproduce recent experimental results on actin flow and stress patterns. Furthermore, we explore the phase diagram of cell motility by varying myosin II activity and adhesion strength. Our model suggests that the pattern of the actin flow inside the cell, the cell velocity, and the cell morphology are determined by the integration of actin polymerization, myosin contraction, adhesion forces, and membrane forces.},

  abstract = {Detecting ellipses from images is a fundamental task in many computer vision applications. However, due to the complexity of real-world scenarios, it is still a challenge to detect ellipses accurately and efficiently. In this paper, we propose a novel method to tackle this problem based on the fast computation of convex hull and directed graph, which achieves promising results on both accuracy and efficiency. We use Depth-First-Search to extract branch-free curves after adaptive edge detection. Line segments are used to represent the curvature characteristic of the curves, followed by splitting at sharp corners and inflection points to attain smooth arcs. Then the convex hull is constructed, together with the distance, length, and direction constraints, to find co-elliptic arc pairs. Arcs and their connectivity are encoded into a sparse directed graph, and then ellipses are generated via a fast access of the adjacency list. Finally, salient ellipses are selected subject to strict verification and weighted clustering. Extensive experiments are conducted on eight real-world datasets (six publicly available and two built by ourselves), as well as five synthetic datasets. Our method achieves the overall highest F-measure with competitive speed compared to representative state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Over the past decade, several biclustering approaches have been published in the field of gene expression data analysis. Despite of huge diversity regarding the mathematical concepts of the different biclustering methods, many of them can be related to the singular value decomposition (SVD). Recently, a sparse SVD approach (SSVD) has been proposed to reveal biclusters in gene expression data. In this article, we propose to incorporate stability selection to improve this method. Stability selection is a subsampling-based variable selection that allows to control Type I error rates. The here proposed S4VD algorithm incorporates this subsampling approach to find stable biclusters, and to estimate the selection probabilities of genes and samples to belong to the biclusters.Results: So far, the S4VD method is the first biclustering approach that takes the cluster stability regarding perturbations of the data into account. Application of the S4VD algorithm to a lung cancer microarray dataset revealed biclusters that correspond to coregulated genes associated with cancer subtypes. Marker genes for different lung cancer subtypes showed high selection probabilities to belong to the corresponding biclusters. Moreover, the genes associated with the biclusters belong to significantly enriched cancer-related Gene Ontology categories. In a simulation study, the S4VD algorithm outperformed the SSVD algorithm and two other SVD-related biclustering methods in recovering artificial biclusters and in being robust to noisy data.Availability: R-Code of the S4VD algorithm as well as a documentation can be found at http://s4vd.r-forge.r-project.org/.Contact:m.sill@dkfz.deSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Then elliptic segments are fitted directly with non-iterative ellipse-specific method proposed by Fitzgibbon et al[12]. For pseudo-elliptic segments, we start fitting ellipse with large eccentricity, merge nearby pseudo-elliptic segments that share same monotonicity, validate fitted ellipse, and accept if validation succeeds. If validation fails, fitting process is repeated by lowering eccentricity until either validation succeeds or eccentricity hits zero. We tested the method on some satellite image and obtained good results.},

Perhaps the most important question that will affect Bitcoin's success, is whether or not it will be able to scale to support the high volume of transactions required from a global currency system. We investigate the implications of having a higher transaction throughput on Bitcoin's security against double-spend attacks. We show that at high throughput, substantially weaker attackers are able to reverse payments they have made, even well after they were considered accepted by recipients. We address this security concern through the GHOST rule, a modification to the way Bitcoin nodes construct and re-organize the block chain, Bitcoin's core distributed data-structure. GHOST has been adopted and a variant of it has been implemented as part of the Ethereum project, a second generation distributed applications platform.},

  publisher = {{Nanyang Technological University}},
  doi = {10.32657/10356/161165},
  abstract = {Deep learning, enabled by the advancements of hardware accelerators, is increasingly employed in cyber-physical systems due to its capabilities in capturing sophisticated patterns from complex physical processes. However, deep learning is shown susceptible to adversarial examples, which are crafted inputs aiming to cause wrong classification outputs for deep models by adding minute perturbations on the clean inputs. Thus, deploying deep learning models on the safety-critical cyber-physical systems without incorporating effective countermeasures against adversarial examples raises security concerns.  This thesis investigates the threat of adversarial example attack and develops effective defenses for two deep learning-based autonomous sensing tasks of cyber-physical systems, i.e., visual sensing of advanced driver assistance systems and drones as well as the voltage stability assessment of smart grids.    Deep learning achieves appealing performance in accurate and resilient perception of complex environments. Thus, deep models are increasingly adopted for visual sensing in autonomous systems such as vehicles and drones. However, it is shown that deep models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Specifically, once the attackers obtain the deep model, they can construct adversarial examples to mislead the model to yield wrong classification results. Deployable adversarial examples such as small stickers pasted on the road signs and lanes have been shown effective in misleading advanced driver-assistance systems. Most existing countermeasures against adversarial examples build their security on the attackers' ignorance of the defense mechanisms. Thus, they fall short of following Kerckhoffs's principle and can be subverted once the attackers know the details of the defense. This thesis proposes DeepMTD, which applies the strategy of moving target defense (MTD) to generate multiple new deep models after system deployment, that will collaboratively detect and thwart adversarial examples. The MTD design in DeepMTD is based on the adversarial examples' minor transferability across different models. The post-deployment of dynamically generated models significantly increases the bar of successful attacks. This thesis also investigates serial data fusion with early stopping for DeepMTD to reduce the inference time by a factor of up to 5, as well as exploits hardware inference accelerators' characteristics to strike better trade-offs between inference time and power consumption. Evaluation based on three datasets including a road sign dataset and two GPU-equipped embedded computing boards shows the effectiveness and efficiency of DeepMTD in counteracting the attack.    To further advance the MTD defense, this thesis presents Sardino, an active and dynamic defense approach that renews the inference ensemble at run time to develop security against the adaptive adversary who tries to exfiltrate the ensemble and construct the corresponding effective adversarial examples. By applying consistency check and data fusion on the ensemble's predictions, Sardino can detect and thwart adversarial inputs. Compared with the training-based ensemble renewal approach adopted by DeepMTD, Sardino uses HyperNet to achieve one million times acceleration and per-frame ensemble renewal that presents the highest level of difficulty to the prerequisite exfiltration attacks. This thesis designs a run-time planner for Sardino that maximizes the ensemble size in favor of security while maintaining the processing frame rate. Beyond adversarial examples, Sardino can also address the issue of out-of-distribution inputs effectively. This thesis presents extensive evaluation of Sardino's performance in counteracting adversarial examples and applies it to build a real-time car-borne traffic sign recognition system. Live on-road tests show the built system's effectiveness in maintaining frame rate and detecting out-of-distribution inputs due to the false positives of a preceding YOLO-based traffic sign detector.    Voltage stability assessment is essential for maintaining reliable power grid operations. Stability assessment approaches using deep learning address the shortfalls of the traditional time-domain simulation-based approaches caused by increased system complexity. However, deep learning models are shown vulnerable to adversarial examples in the field of computer vision. While this vulnerability has been noticed by the power grid cybersecurity research, the domain-specific analysis on the requirements imposed upon effective attack implementation is still lacking. Although these attack requirements are usually reasonable in computer vision tasks, they can be stringent in the context of power grids. This thesis conducts a systematic investigation on the attack requirements and credibility of six representative adversarial example attacks based on a voltage stability assessment application for the New England 10-machine 39-bus power system. The investigation in this thesis shows that (1) compromising about half the transmission system buses' voltage traces is a rule-of-thumb attack requirement; (2) the universal adversarial perturbations regardless of the original clean voltage trajectory possess the same credibility as the widely studied false data injection attacks on power grid state estimation, while the input-specific adversarial perturbations are less credible; (3) the prevailing strong adversarial training thwarts the universal perturbations but fails in defending certain input-specific perturbations. To advance defense to cope with both universal and input-specific adversarial examples, this thesis proposes a new approach that simultaneously estimates the predictive uncertainty of any given input of voltage trajectory and thwarts the attacks effectively.    To summarize, this thesis studies the threat and countermeasures for the adversarial example attack as an ongoing concern for the safety-critical autonomous cyber-physical systems. It develops DeepMTD and Sardino, which are two dynamic ensemble-based defenses designed under the strategy of moving target defense, to effectively counteract the adaptive adversarial example adversary for embedded deep visual sensing. It also conducts the systematic requirement investigation and credibility analysis of adversarial example attack against the power grid voltage stability assessment and develops effective countermeasure.},

A standard approach distributes the graph over a cluster of nodes, but performing computations on a distributed graph is expensive if large amount of data have to be moved. Without partitioning the graph, communication quickly becomes a limiting factor in scaling the system up. Existing graph partitioning heuristics incur high computation and communication cost on large graphs, sometimes as high as the future computation itself. Observing that the graph has to be loaded into the cluster, we ask if the partitioning can be done at the same time with a lightweight streaming algorithm.},

  abstract = {The explosion of the biological data has dramatically reformed today's biological research. The need to integrate and analyze high-dimensional biological data on a large scale is driving the development of novel bioinformatics approaches. Biclustering, also known as 'simultaneous clustering' or 'co-clustering', has been successfully utilized to discover local patterns in gene expression data and similar biomedical data types. Here, we contribute a new heuristic: 'Bi-Force'. It is based on the weighted bicluster editing model, to perform biclustering on arbitrary sets of biological entities, given any kind of pairwise similarities. We first evaluated the power of Bi-Force to solve dedicated bicluster editing problems by comparing Bi-Force with two existing algorithms in the BiCluE software package. We then followed a biclustering evaluation protocol in a recent review paper from Eren et al. (2013) (A comparative analysis of biclustering algorithms for gene expressiondata. Brief. Bioinform., 14:279-292.) and compared Bi-Force against eight existing tools: FABIA, QUBIC, Cheng and Church, Plaid, BiMax, Spectral, xMOTIFs and ISA. To this end, a suite of synthetic datasets as well as nine large gene expression datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus were analyzed. All resulting biclusters were subsequently investigated by Gene Ontology enrichment analysis to evaluate their biological relevance. The distinct theoretical foundation of Bi-Force (bicluster editing) is more powerful than strict biclustering. We thus outperformed existing tools with Bi-Force at least when following the evaluation protocols from Eren et al. Bi-Force is implemented in Java and integrated into the open source software package of BiCluE. The software as well as all used datasets are publicly available at http://biclue.mpi-inf.mpg.de.},

Currently, practitioners must choose between algebraic methods that guarantee an ellipse fit but exhibit high bias, and geometric methods that are less biased but may no longer guarantee an ellipse solution. We address this limitation by proposing a method that strikes a balance between these two objectives. Specifically, we propose a fast stable algorithm for fitting a guaranteed ellipse to data using the Sampson distance as a data-parameter discrepancy measure. We validate the stability, accuracy, and efficiency of our method on both real and synthetic data. Experimental results show that our algorithm is a fast and accurate approximation of the computationally more expensive orthogonal-distance-based ellipse fitting method. In view of these qualities, our method may be of interest to practitioners who require accurate and guaranteed ellipse estimates. \textcopyright{} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Generation of ellipses, not just conics, as estimates is ensured through the use of a parametrisation of the set of all ellipses. Optimisation of the Sampson distance is performed with the aid of a custom variant of the Levenberg\textendash Marquardt algorithm. The method is supplemented with a measure of uncertainty of an ellipse fit in two closely related forms. One of these concerns the uncertainty in the algebraic parameters of the fit and the other pertains to the uncertainty in the geometrically meaningful parameters of the fit such as the centre, axes, and major axis orientation. In addition, a means is provided for visualising the uncertainty of an ellipse fit in the form of planar confidence regions. For moderate noise levels, the proposed estimator produces results that are fully comparable in accuracy to those produced by the much slower maximum likelihood estimator. Due to its speed and simplicity, the method may prove useful in numerous industrial applications where a measure of reliability for geometric ellipse parameters is required.},

  abstract = {This paper considers eye images observed by a system such as an infrared eye-movement observation system in which the relative position of the head and camera is kept constant. A highly accurate detection method for the pupil image is proposed. Assuming that the eyeball has a spherical shape and the contour of the pupil is a circle, the pupil is observed as an ellipse accompanying movement of the eyeball. By accurately detecting this pupil image of elliptical shape, it is possible to detect the eye direction stably. Various methods of detecting an ellipse have been presented, and the Hough transform is one of these. The Hough transform has the feature that it is less affected by noise and occlusion. In the detection of ellipses in general, the number of degrees of freedom is represented by five parameters to be determined, which may produce problems of computational complexity and memory requirements. On the other hand, in order that the pupil may rotate around the eyeball center, the pupil image observed depends on a position and a direction from the eyeball center, without becoming general ellipse form. In this study, the above constraint is utilized, and an algorithm is discussed in which the pupil is detected with high accuracy based on the eyeball model. In the algorithm, the processing efficiency of the whole system is considered. In the algorithm, first, initial detection of the pupil is performed by ellipse fitting based on the edges in multiple observed images, and the parameters of the eyeball model are estimated on the basis of the results. Then, the Hough transform is applied on the basis of the estimated eyeball parameters, and the pupil contour is detected with high accuracy. The experimental results show that the accuracy and stability of pupil contour detection is improved, indicating that the proposed method is effective. \textcopyright{} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Namely, cities have installed sound-emitting devices into traffic lights as well as sidewalks that assist their navigation. Moreover, as cities are always striving to move forward and achieve innovations concerning navigation for disabled individuals, smart traffic lights, capable of synchronizing in real-time according to traffic and individual mobility conditions, are already being installed around the world. This is in line with the adoption of the smart city concept, which involves a set of methodologies and indicators that regulate how cities perform regarding the promotion of citizens' quality of life. Another important principle is the techno-economic aspect indicating the need for low-cost careful planning to produce cost-efficient solutions, while additional important issues are maintenance, power efficiency, and the means to coordinate numerous devices to facilitate operation in a timely and reliable manner. In this article, we present an overview of the existing solutions for the navigation of people who are blind and visually impaired along with a requirement analysis performed on the feedback received from interviews with members of the Lighthouse for the Blind of Greece both of which lead to the proposal of a new implementation that pushes the state of the art.},

  abstract = {When broadcasting sports events such as football, it is useful to be able to place virtual annotations on the pitch, to indicate things such as distances between players and the goal, or whether a player is offside. This requires the camera position, orientation, and focal length to be estimated in real time, so that the graphics can be rendered to match the camera view. Whilst this can be achieved by using sensors on the camera mount and lens, they can be impractical or expensive to install, and often the broadcaster only has access to the video feed itself. This paper presents a method for computing the position, orientation and focal length of a camera in real time, using image analysis. The method uses markings on the pitch, such as arcs and lines, to compute the camera pose. A novel feature of the method is the use of multiple images to improve the accuracy of the camera position estimate. A means of automatically initialising the tracking process is also presented, which makes use of a modified form of Hough transform. The paper shows how a carefully chosen set of algorithms can provide fast, robust and accurate tracking for this real-world application.},

Generally, trading between different currencies is conducted through a centralized third-party platform. However, it has the problem of a single point of failure, which is vulnerable to attacks and thus affects the security of the transactions. In this paper, we propose a distributed cryptocurrency trading scheme to solve the problem of centralized exchanges, which can achieve secure trading between different types of cryptocurrencies. Our scheme is implemented with smart contracts on an Ethereum blockchain and deployed on an Ethereum test network. In addition to implementing transactions between individual users, our scheme also allows transactions among multiple users. The experimental result proves that the cost of our scheme is acceptable.},

Our method maps an arbitrary cell shape onto a tree graph that, unlike traditional skeletonization algorithms, preserves complex boundary features.

However, the choice of these hyperparameters has always been challenging in both theory and practice. The {$\nu$}-support vector regression eliminates the need to specify an {$\epsilon$} value elegantly, but at the cost of specifying or postulating a {$\nu$} value. We propose an extended primal objective function arising from probability regularization leading to an automatic selection of {$\epsilon$}, and we can express {$\nu$} as an explicit function of {$\epsilon$}. The resultant hyperparameter values can be interpreted as `working' values required only in training but not testing or prediction. This regularized algorithm, namely {$\epsilon$}*-SVR, automatically provides a data-dependent {$\epsilon$} and is found to have a close connection to the {$\nu$}-support vector regression in the sense that {$\nu$} as a fraction is a sensible function of {$\epsilon$}. The {$\epsilon$}*-SVR automatically selects both {$\nu$} and {$\epsilon$} values. We illustrate these findings with some public benchmark datasets.},

  abstract = {The analysis of tensor data is necessary in many applications. Similar to bi-clustering of matrix data, multiscale co-clustering can simultaneously extract coherent patterns along all or partial modes of a tensor. However, numerical methods for co-clustering have not reached the level of maturity of bi-clustering. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework to perform co-clustering for multidimensional data based on tensor and matrix decomposition. According to the proposed principle, we first develop an alternative algorithm for tensor canonical decomposition with full-rank constraint on slice-wise factorization (FRSF). Owing to the least squares principle and the constraint inherent in the resolution of multidimensional data, FRSF provides a natural way to avoid two-factor degeneracy and renders the resolved profiles stable with respect to high dimensionality. FRSF maintains a high convergence rate and greatly reduces the computational complexity with the compression technique based on matrix singular value decomposition. Furthermore, the algebraic expression of co-clusters in tensor data can be mapped to some linear structures in the factor spaces of FRSF. We employ a linear grouping algorithm to identify these geometrical patterns in the factor spaces. Finally, the combination of the linear grouping points along every mode successfully supports the detection of co-clusters in tensor data. On the basis of the proposed framework, a flexible and fast FRSF-based co-clustering algorithm is developed. Extensive simulations and experiment data analysis demonstrate the validity and efficiency of FRSF and the proposed co-clustering algorithm.},

This problem was first formulated by identifying a number of criteria required for the ellipse fitting. A solution is then proposed for automatically determining the set of ellipses that best fits onto an image region. The proposed ellipse fitting algorithm has also been applied to strokes forming characters of Chinese calligraphic artwork. The results show that our proposed algorithm generates ellipses fitting onto stroke regions and capturing the characteristics of the strokes during turning, tilting and back-trace.},

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as honest nodes control the most CPU power on the network, they can generate the longest chain and outpace any attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

  abstract = {Several types of geological problem involve fitting an ellipse to sparse data in order to define a property such as strain or curvature. The sensitivity of ellipse-fitting algorithms to noise in input geological data is often poorly documented. Here we compare the performance of some well-known approaches to this problem in geology against each other and an algorithm developed for machine vision. The specific methods tested here are an analytical method, a Mohr diagram method, two least squares methods and a constrained ellipse approach. The algorithms were tested on artificial datasets of known elliptical and noise properties. These results allow the selection of an ellipse fitting method in a variety of geological applications and also allow an assessment of the absolute and relative accuracy of a chosen method for various combinations of sample numbers and noise levels. For the most accurate semi axis magnitude and orientation estimates with five or more input data, the `mean object' least squares approach is recommended. However, the other least squares method also yields good results and is also suitable for three or four data points. Where curvature data is being assessed, the least squares method is preferred as it can handle negative principal curvature values.},

In this paper, we proposed an effective ellipse detector benefiting from the region detection method, which provides a basic estimation on the region and size of ellipses. Then, a two-level arc pruning strategy is proposed to detect ellipses efficiently while limiting false-positive and false-negative results. Furthermore, for the pre-estimated region without detected ellipses, interpolation method is employed to enlarge the target region, which makes small and blur ellipses to be detected. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {Automated assembly of 3C (Computer, Communication, and Consumer Electronics) parts has attracted increasing attention from the manufacturing industry in recent years. Employing various types of vision sensors to assist robots in completing high-precision assembly tasks has become one of the most effective methods. There appears to be such a complicated situation in the actual manufacturing assembly line. The two parts to be assembled simultaneously have pose uncertainty when one part clamped at the end-effector after robotic grasping needs to be aligned with another part randomly placed on the workbench. This paper presents an automatic high-precision assembly system based on 6D pose estimation and visual servoing by using multiple cameras for the solution. A pose compensation strategy and real-time visual servoing approaches are implemented to tackle pose errors from grasping and to align the target to be assembled with a random pose. Our assembly strategy is composed of three stages. In the first stage, a high-resolution monocular camera is employed to estimate the 6D pose of the part which is clamped by the gripper and calculate the grasping error relative to the standard pose with the eye-hand system. After that, a visual servoing controller is employed sequentially to locate and align the part on the platform with an RGB-D camera. Once the servoing finished, correct the clamped parts to the standard post through robot motion compensation to eliminate grasping errors. The proposed approach is verified by experiments, which can be used to accomplish automated assembly tasks even if two parts to be assembled both exist in uncertain poses. The proposed assembly system appears to be flexible and efficient for high-precision assembly, such as 3C products.},

Great facial variations, especially pose or viewpoint changes, typically degrade the performance of classical methods. Recent learning or regression-based approaches highly rely on the availability of a training set that covers facial variations as wide as possible. In this paper, we introduce and extend a novel projective invariant, named the characteristic number (CN), which unifies the collinearity, cross ratio, and geometrical characteristics given by more (6) points. We derive strong shape priors from CN statistics on a moderate size (515) of frontal upright faces in order to characterize the intrinsic geometries shared by human faces. We combine these shape priors with simple appearance based constraints, e.g., texture, edge, and corner, into a quadratic optimization. Thereafter, the solution to facial point extraction can be found by the standard gradient descent. The inclusion of these shape priors renders the robustness to pose changes owing to their invariance to projective transformations. Extensive experiments on the Labeled Faces in the Wild, Labeled Face Parts in the Wild and Helen database, and cross-set faces with various changes demonstrate the effectiveness of the CN-based shape priors compared with the state of the art.},

NFC security standard requires the use of public key infrastructure (PKI) to implement mutual authentication and session keys negotiation in order to ensure communication security. In traditional PKI-based schemes, every user uses a fixed public/private key pair to implement authentication and key agreement. An attacker can create a profile based on user's public key to track and compromise the user's privacy. Recently, He et al. and Odelu et al. successively proposed pseudonym-based authentication key and agreement protocols for NFC after Eun et al.'s protocol (2013), which is first claimed to provide conditional privacy for NFC. They respectively claimed that their scheme can satisfy the security requirements. In this paper, first, we prove that their protocols still have security flaws, including the confusion of the user's identity and the random identity. Then, we propose a pseudonym-based secure authentication protocol (PSAP) for NFC applications, which is effective in lifetime and includes time synchronization-based method and nonce-based method. In our scheme, trusted service manager issues pseudonyms but does not need to maintain verification tables and it could reveal the user's identity of internal attackers. Furthermore, security and performance analysis proves that PSAP can provide traceability and more secure features with a little more cost.},

For each voting angle \texttheta, the voting distance p is considered to be a stochastic variable, where voting values A({$\rho$}, \texttheta ) define the probabilistic weights. We state how the statistical variance is related to the major axis, minor axis, and direction of an elliptic region, and also how the statistical mean is related to the centre; we provide two relationship functions in image space. After voting, a linear function and a quadratic function are fitted in the parameters space. The major axis, minor axis and direction are computed based on the coefficients of the fitted quadratic function. The centre is determined by using the coefficients of the fitted linear function. The proposed method is tested on synthetic images and real-world images. Experimental results show that the method extracts accurately parameters of elliptic regions, even in noisy and low-resolution images.},

In this paper, we propose Healthchain, a large-scale health data privacy preserving scheme based on blockchain technology, where health data are encrypted to conduct fine-grained access control. Specifically, users can effectively revoke or add authorized doctors by leveraging user transactions for key management. Furthermore, by introducing Healthchain, both IoT data and doctor diagnosis cannot be deleted or tampered with so as to avoid medical disputes. Security analysis and experimental results show that the proposed Healthchain is applicable for smart healthcare system.},

Traditionally, in order to access a network, a user is authorized with an identity and corresponding keys, which are generated and managed by the network operator. All users' personally identifying information are centralized stored by the network operator. However, this approach makes users lose the control of their personally identifying information. Users are concerned about who can access these sensitive data and whether they have been compromised. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based identity management and authentication scheme for mobile networks, where users' identifying information are controlled by the users themselves. Our scheme let users generate their self-sovereign identities (SSIs) and corresponding public keys and private keys. The private key used to authenticate the user's identifying information is only known to the user. We use blockchain to record SSIs and public keys of legitimate user, and adopt chameleon hash to delete illegal users' information on the blockchain, while keeping the block head unchanged. Furthermore, other service providers can obtain the user's SSI and public key and authenticate users by querying the blockchain. Experimental results confirm that our scheme can greatly reduce the revocation overhead and communication overhead.},

Although existing schemes improve blockchain throughput by allowing multiple miners to append blocks to the blockchain concurrently, little attention has been devoted to how to adjust blockchain throughput dynamically and how to avoid transaction duplication between concurrent blocks. This paper presents an adaptive scaling blockchain protocol with deduplication of transactions. When the transaction demand in the network is high, the blockchain expands to meet users' demand; when the transaction demand is low, the blockchain shrinks to save communication and storage costs. We design a transaction deduplication mechanism to ensure that no duplicate transactions are appended to the blockchain to improve bandwidth utilization and achieve higher effective throughput. Besides, the mining power load balancing mechanism can ensure the security of the blockchain by splitting adversaries' mining power. The proposed prototype has been implemented on Amazon EC2.

This feature is leading to a new trend that traditional wireless users are willing to roam to SIN to obtain a better service. However, the features of exposed links and higher signal latency in SIN make it difficult to design a secure and fast roaming authentication scheme for this new trend. Although some existing researches have been focused on designing secure authentication protocols for SIN or providing roaming authentication protocols for traditional wireless networks, these schemes cannot provide adequate requirements for the roaming communication in SIN and bring in critical issues, such as the privacy leakage or intolerable authentication delay. Observing these problems have not been well addressed, we design an anonymous and fast roaming authentication scheme for SIN. In our scheme, we utilize the group signature to provide the anonymity for roaming users, and assume that the satellites have limited computing capacity and make them have the defined authentication function to avoid the real-time involvement of the home network control center when authenticating the roaming users. The results of security and performance analysis show that the proposed scheme can provide the required security features, while providing a small authentication delay.},

However, the research on the image processing of BR code are rare and the field of BR code detection and identification is almost blank so far, which impede the use of BR code in practical scenarios. In the application of BR code, distortion problems such as tilt and perspective of the image may lead to difficulty in identifying the BR code. In addition, in some industrial scenarios, we hope that the BR code can be instantly recognized to meet the real-time requirement. In this paper, an efficient image processing and detection method for BR code images with complex background is proposed.

  abstract = {Blockchain is an emerging technology for sharing transactional data and computation without using a central trusted third party. It is an architectural choice to use a blockchain instead of traditional databases or protocols, and this creates trade-offs between non-functional requirements such as performance, cost, and security. However, little is known about predicting the behaviour of blockchain-based systems. This paper shows the feasibility of using architectural performance modelling and simulation tools to predict the latency of blockchain-based systems. We use established tools and techniques, but explore new blockchain-specific issues such as the configuration of the number of confirmation blocks and inter-block times. We report on a lab-based experimental study using an incident management system, showing predictions of median system level response time with a relative error mostly under 10\%. We discuss how the approach can be used to support architectural decision-making, during the design of blockchain-based systems.},

  abstract = {Riemannian manifold plays a vital role as a powerful mathematical tool in computer vision, with important applications in curved shape analysis and classification. Significant progress has recently been made by Riemannian framework based methods that achieved state-of-the-art classification accuracy and robustness. However, these Riemannian manifold and Lie group methods require a very high computational complexity and do not include a description of the shape regions. This paper presents a novel mathematical tool, called Block Diagonal Symmetric Positive Definite Matrix Lie Algebra (BDSPDMLA) to represent curves, which extends the existing Lie group representations to a compact yet informative Lie algebra representation. The proposed Lie algebra based method addresses the computational bottleneck problem of the Riemannian framework based methods. In addition, it allows the natural fusion of various regions information with curved shape features for a more discriminative shape description. Here the region information is represented by values of distance maps, local binary patterns (LBP) and image intensity. Extensive experiments on five publicly available databases demonstrate that the proposed Lie algebra based method can achieve a speed of over ten thousand times faster than the Riemannian manifold and Lie group based baseline methods, while obtaining comparable accuracies for 2D shape classification.},

  abstract = {Accurate ellipse detection in complicated images is a challenging problem due to corruptions from image clutter, noise, or occlusion of other objects. To cope with this problem, an edge-following-based ellipse detection method is proposed which promotes the performances of the subprocesses based on consistency. The ellipse detector models edge connectivity by line segments and exploits inconsistent endpoints of the line segments to split the edge contours into smooth arcs. The smooth arcs are further refined with a novel arc refinement method which iteratively improves the consistency degree of the smooth arc. A two-phase arc integration method is developed to group disconnected elliptical arcs belonging to the same ellipse, and two constraints based on consistency are defined to increase the effectiveness and speed of the merging process. Finally, an efficient ellipse validation method is proposed to evaluate the saliency of the elliptic hypotheses. Detailed evaluation on synthetic images shows that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art ellipse detection methods in terms of effectiveness and speed. Additionally, we test our detector on three challenging real-world datasets. The F-measure score and execution time of results demonstrate that our method is effective and fast in complicated images. Therefore, the proposed method is suitable for practical applications.},

  abstract = {Co-clustering, often called biclustering for two-dimensional data, has found many applications, such as gene expression data analysis and text mining. Nowadays, a variety of multidimensional arrays (tensors) frequently occur in data analysis tasks, and co-clustering techniques play a key role in dealing with such datasets. Co-clusters represent coherent patterns and exhibit important properties along all the modes. Development of robust coclustering techniques is important for the detection and analysis of these patterns. In this paper, a co-clustering method based on hyperplane detection in singular vector spaces (HDSVS) is proposed. Specifically in this method, higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) transforms a tensor into a core part and a singular vector matrix along each mode, whose row vectors can be clustered by a linear grouping algorithm (LGA). Meanwhile, hyperplanar patterns are extracted and successfully supported the identification of multi-dimensional co-clusters. To validate HDSVS, a number of synthetic and biological tensors were adopted. The synthetic tensors attested a favorable performance of this algorithm on noisy or overlapped data. Experiments with gene expression data and lineage data of embryonic cells further verified the reliability of HDSVS to practical problems. Moreover, the detected co-clusters are well consistent with important genetic pathways and gene ontology annotations. Finally, a series of comparisons between HDSVS and state-of-the-art methods on synthetic tensors and a yeast gene expression tensor were implemented, verifying the robust and stable performance of our method.},

  abstract = {Fitting ellipses from unrecognized data is a fundamental problem in computer vision and pattern recognition. Classic least-squares based methods are sensitive to outliers. To address this problem, in this paper, we present a novel and effective method called hierarchical Gaussian mixture models (HGMM) for ellipse fitting in noisy, outliers-contained, and occluded settings on the basis of Gaussian mixture models (GMM). This method is crafted into two layers to significantly improve its fitting accuracy and robustness for data containing outliers/noise and has been proven to effectively narrow down the iterative interval of the kernel bandwidth, thereby speeding up ellipse fitting. Extensive experiments are conducted on synthetic data including substantial outliers (up to 60\%) and strong noise (up to 200\%) as well as on real images including complex benchmark images with heavy occlusion and images from versatile applications. We compare our results with those of representative state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate that our proposed method has several salient advantages, such as its high robustness against outliers and noise, high fitting accuracy, and improved performance.},
